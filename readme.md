## Objective

Our goal is to build a serverless, progressive web app (MEET) that leverages the Google Calendar API for data retrieval. The key objectives are as follows:

- **Serverless**: Enjoy the benefits of serverless architecture, including effortless scalability, constant availability, and zero cost for idle resources.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Experience instant loading, offline support, push notifications, the "add to home screen" prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Technologies Used

Technology stack includes:

- React
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Google Calendar API
- OAuth2 authentication flow
- AWS Lambda (for serverless functions)
- Authorization server
- React Axios with async/await
- An alert system implemented using an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach

## Key Features

Discover the app's core features:

- Filter events by city
- Toggle event details visibility
- Specify the number of events
- Seamless offline usage
- Add the app to your device's home screen
- Visualize upcoming events by city with an interactive chart

## Technical Requirements

To ensure the highest quality and performance, the app adheres to these technical requirements:

- Developed using React
- Built with Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
- Utilizes Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow
- Employs serverless functions (preferably AWS Lambda) for the authorization server
- Hosted on GitHub for transparent code management
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, and IE11)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes (from 320px to 1920px)
- Passes Lighthouse's Progressive Web App (PWA) checklist
- Works offline and gracefully handles slow network conditions with a service worker
- Supports desktop installation and mobile home screen addition
- Utilizes React Axios and async/await for API calls
- Implements an alert system using an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach
- Incorporates data visualization
- Maintains a test coverage rate of 90% or higher
- Monitored using an online monitoring tool
